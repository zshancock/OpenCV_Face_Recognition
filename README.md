## OpenCV_Face_Recognition
Using OpenCV 3.3, I trained a program that can detect and identify celebrity faces for Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift and Drake.


## In progress - descriptive README coming soon... project is complete, just working on the readme for GitHub. 
For now... the end product is summarized by the one validation image pair (test1 and test1_pred). The program outlines the face of the
target with a label.
